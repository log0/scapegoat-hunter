Project : Scapegoat Hunter

Contact : ky.log0@gmail.com

This is a wrapper to Nmap. It is used scan ip ranges to locate proxies that can be used
for auditing purposes. Or can be used for hunting out "scapegoats" for doing crimes, or
reaching into certain filtered areas.

The code currently can find proxies that works, but does not identify the type of
proxy the IP is. And this cannot identify proxy that injects code, which means for
proxies that modify the HTTP source or has a "welcome" screen, the script cannot
yet detect them.
